# firstapp - mynotes

Application developed using Dart, a programming language developed by Google, designed for web, server, mobile, and desktop application development. Its main goal is to provide a robust and efficient language for creating modern and reactive user interfaces.

This is a notes web and mobile application. Somo of its most important functionalities are: 
- Cloud registration and user verification via email.
- User login and logout of the application.
- Creation, editing, deletion, and sharing of notes.
- Notes cloud management.

Program developed to learn the language and experiment with the fast development, object-oriented, and cross-platform features this technology offers.
